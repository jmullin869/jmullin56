    Background on Malenia, Blade of Miquella, is one of the most feared figures in Elden Ring., Malenia is cursed with the Scarlet Rot, a disease that ravages her body and warps her into a force of destruction. While Miquella embodies hope and purity, Malenia’s fate is bound to the Rot. Her strength lies not only in her unmatched swordsmanship but also in her ability to heal herself with every strike she lands, making her an especially challenging boss many of which claim to make her the hardest boss in the game.

    To reach the arena of Malenia, players must first journey through the Haligtree, an ancient and forgotten place hidden deep within the Lands Between. To access the Haligtree you must first defeat Morgott, the Omen King, and navigate through the map until you reach the Consecrated snowfields. You’ll eventually find the Haligtree by interacting with a Waygate in the consecrated snowfields. Once you reach the tree itself you progress through the area before finally reaching a grand hall this is where the fight against her will unfold.

    The battle with Malenia is one of the toughest in Elden Ring. In the first phase, Her attacks come quickly and with little warning, and if she lands a blow, she heals herself. But her most dangerous ability is her connection to the Scarlet Rot. When you get too close, the rot spreads, poisoning you and damaging your health over time. As you whittle down her health, and just when you think you have defeated her and her health hits zero Malenia enters the second phase, with a full health bar and the battle intensifies. her attacks become even faster and deadlier. Now, in addition to her rapid sword strikes, she summons waves of rot that spread across the battlefield. Her ability to heal with every hit remains intact, meaning you have to play perfectly to avoid her.
