    Background on the fight upon entering the arena you finally come upon Gurranq also known as the beast clergyman, who attempts to stop them from stealing the Rune of Death from him. Despite his best efforts, Gurranq struggles. As a last resort, he unbinds his death-imbued blade from his flesh and reveals his true identity, Maliketh, the Black Blade. Maliketh is a powerful warrior who guards the Rune of Death, a dangerous power that can kill even immortals. He was created to protect this rune and its secrets. After the Elden Ring is shattered, Maliketh becomes one of the key figures trying to keep things in balance. His title, "Black Blade," comes from his connection to death and destruction.

 <p>
    Where to locate Maliketh, Maliketh is located in Crumbling Farum Azula. you can only access Crumbling Farum Azula after defeating the Fire Giant at Flame Peak and going through a short dialogue with Milena you will set the Erdtree ablaze at the Giant's Forge after this scene is over the character finds himself waking up in Crumbling Farum Azula, an ancient city in the sky. Once here you will have to progress through the area fighting other bosses such as the Godskin Duo, as well as optional fights that you can choose to fight or run by ones like the tree sentinel placed outside the arena of Maliketh.

    Upon entering the arena you are met with the beast clergyman. This is the first phase of the fight and is relatively easy compared to what is to come later. Once you get the beast clergyman to about half health the fight will be interrupted by a cut scene this is where the beast takes his sword and stabs it through the talisman on his hand and unleashes his true powers, turning the beast into Maliketh. The second phase of this fight is where the fight heats up, unlike many other bosses he uses a completely new arsenal of attacks compared to his first phase, very powerful and quick attacks that will wipe you out in no time.
