    In the Elden Ring DLC, Radahn is a powerful figure who’s become even more dangerous than the first time the Tarnished fought him. Radahn was originally a great warrior and general, his strength came from his control over gravity. However, after the shattering of the Elden Ring, he’s become cursed, and his body is now distorted and uncontrollable. What was once a heroic battle to keep the stars from falling has turned into a horrifying struggle as his powers spiral out of control. He is no longer the noble protector he once was; instead, he become a force of destruction, caught in a curse that twists his body and mind.

    In the fight itself from the beginning you can tell that his attacks are stronger and more chaotic, combining gravity-based magic with powerful physical strikes. The most notable difference in the actual look of the fight itself is that Radahn’s warhorse is now gone. His massive body caused the ground to tremble. once you get him to about 65% health the fight shifts into its second phase. In the second phase of the fight, He is no longer “The Promised Consort” and is now “Radahn, Consort of Miqella” Radahn also appears with Miqella on his back. Radahn becomes even more dangerous. Unleashing even more devastating attacks, like a new grab that is completed twice instantly kills the player. The sky above begins to rain down meteors, and the battlefield shakes as Radahn’s powers grow uncontrollably.  with Radahn’s attacks coming faster and harder, there is not much room for error in this fight and any mistakes made in this fight will be punished.
